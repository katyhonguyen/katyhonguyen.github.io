        Hi and welcome to my page! I'm passionate about design and all things creative, In my free time, I like to crochet, craft bead charms, and explore new cafes in the area. I'm taking this decal to learn more about web design and development because I want to build my own website.

        <li>Reading the article, I learned that design should be analyzed to understand the intention behind the process and how it is able to solve a specific problem that exists in the world. I liked how the article broke down the different components to look out for such as hirearchy and what audience the product is designed for. </li>
        <li>My favorite part was how they broke down the app layout and noted down observations to look for. This part explains why a specific language choice is made to initate an certain action</li>
        <li>"Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>
        <li>This article was a 10/10 read!</li>
